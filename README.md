# blockchain-for-ranking-system
>In this project, our goal is to make blockchain intelligent. So we build a private chain from Ethereum and put a machine learning system on it to achieve our goal. That system is about ranking optimization. All the algorithms are made by myself.
There are five files in it, including
* Experient1.py: Verifying our ranking system works.
* Experient2＿Experient3.py: Verifying that using small samples of data input in our ranking system works. And find the smallest samples.
* rating＿for＿solidity＿all＿addevent.sol: Using Solidity code deploys our ranking system on private chain.
* main＿page.html: We have a website to collect ranking from everyone. That is this page.
* result＿page.html: This page shows that the final ranking and history data.
* README.md: Introduction of this project.
